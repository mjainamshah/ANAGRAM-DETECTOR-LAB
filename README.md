# ANAGRAM-DETECTOR-LAB

## LEARNING GOALS:
    - Build a class that uses an initialize method
    - Use an attribute accessor macro to make an attribute available to a class's methods
    - Practice using Ruby list methods

## Setup/Installation Requirements
    - Clone or download zip in the code section of github to your desired folder on your device
    - Extract the files
    - Open the folder with vs code.
    - In the terminal run pipenv install & pipenv shell to get the neccesary dependencies & python files installed.
    - Your application is running! Ready to go!

## Instructions:
    - This is a test-driven lab. Run pipenv install to create your virtual environment and pipenv shell to enter the virtual environment. Then run pytest -x to run your tests. Use these instructions and pytest's error messages to complete your work in the app/ folder.

    - You will write a program that, given a word and a list of possible anagramsLinks to an external site., selects the correct one(s).

    - Your class, Anagram should take a word on initialization; instances should respond to a match() instance method that takes a list of possible anagrams. It should return all matches in a list. If no matches exist, it should return an empty list.

    - In other words, given: 'listen' and ['enlists', 'google', 'inlets', 'banana'] the program should return ['inlets'].

    - Write your solution in lib/anagram.py.

    - Once all of your tests are passing, commit and push your work using git to submit.

    - This is a difficult lab that will require some algorithmic thinking! Try breaking writing out some pseudocode and break the problem down into smaller steps before writing out your implementation.
